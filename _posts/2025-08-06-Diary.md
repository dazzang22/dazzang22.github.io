**Title:** Nothing changes unless u r standing still

Yes. Nothing changes. I make my day. It's my own thing, and I'm the only one who can control me. Why am I still here? Get busy, more and more. Be motivated; don't dwell on the past. It's all over. 

Today's Topic: **What are my strengths when working with others?**

Umm... Well, I'm not that good at team play. That doesn't mean " I DO NOT HAVE any strength." I'm a realistic ppl, so I can I'm good at judging what I can do right now and what I can't. And I don't dump my work on others. I'm a responsible person, and that is what I am. And I always try my best not to harm my team. I wanna be a dependable person whom the whole team can trust.
