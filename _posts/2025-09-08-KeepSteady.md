## 3. 다짱이의 한줄평

뭐 할말이 없네. 지금 듣고있는 노래에서 영어표현 얻어가는 뽀모도로식 아이디어는 좋았는데 듣는 노래 수준이 다 이래서 배울것도 없고 참 ...  
그렇다고 재미없는 노래를 들을 수는 없잖아;  
렌시폭스의 마스터피스 LIVE IN HELL 은 진짜 버릴노래 0곡인거 아시는분?  
렌시폭스오빠 진짜 너무 좋아서 막 사귀고싶음 . . .  
이 앨범이 너무 좋아서 몇월달인지 기억안나는데 이거만 들음  
앨범이 전체적으로 예술가 포저시고 가사도 ㅈㄴ 예술충이신데  
음악력은 참 좋단말이지  
사운드도 목소리도 오토튠도 이렇게 쓰는 남자가 없음  
런던 남자라 더호감인거 아시는분  
오후 10시 32분 렌시폭스오빠 존나 찬양할 시간이네,

## 4. 관련 추천

- **Repeating history - Brokitz**  
  → 아마 이 오빠의 가장 유명한 노래가 아닐까… 진짜 좋음  

- **IF ANYONE ASKED - Brokitz**  
  → *BLUEFUSION* 앨범 수록곡, 짧고 강렬함. 개추   

- **Face It - Brokitz**  
  → 제일 최근 앨범 수록곡인데 좋음.  
    요즘 하이퍼팝 하던 오빵이들이 죄다 랩하니까 나는 좀 당황스럽긴 함.  
    그래도 경계가 사라지는 추세라 재밌고, 사운드 다 좋음.  
    근데 누가 프로듀싱했는지 궁금해 죽겠는데 genius에도 안 나옴 (언더의 서러움;)

[Verse 2]
I got her dragging her mink
She wanna fuck with a prince
I pull up with the Cuban link
No underwear when we link
She popped the perc like a mint
She really tryna go in
I lay it down in the whip
Can't see this shit through the tints
I ain't really tryna be friends
She already know what I meant
Continental the room with a vent
Told sweetie, "This ain't a tent"
My baby, she know what it is
My lady, she know what it is
She ain't tryna let me slip
She tell her friends I'm a myth

[Chorus]
Gorgeous, yeah, she flawless
Yeah, she gorgeous, yeah, she flawless
Yeah, she gorgeous, yeah, she flawless, yeah, yeah (I feel like I'm me, I feel like I'm me)

I'm just being me, she fell in love
I fly overseas, she fell in love
Buy her Celine, she fell in love

I'm just being me, she fell in love, yeah, yeah
