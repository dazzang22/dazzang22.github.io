**Title:** Keep Steady, but lowkey, I can't.

What made me this weak? This nightmare comes every time I'm about to forget. This man is REAL CRUEL. Why can't he be an adult all the time? Why is he being so childish? Can't understand. Does this kind of behavior make you feel better? Never overestimate urself. U can't be my threat anymore.

Please set u free and SET US FREE.

Tdy's topic : What are my weaknesses, and how do I manage them?

My only weakness is self-consciousness. I care too much about what others think, all the time. That doesn't mean I'm timid. I'm just scared that if my opinion gets regretted. It's really hard to manage this. This is my personality, it's part of me. 
But I need to break through this obstacle. These days, I try to set my standard. Self-consciousness sometimes means I'm not sure about myself, and I can't believe myself. Try to make my standard and stake some knowledge that can support my thought really does good on this problem.
