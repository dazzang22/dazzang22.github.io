**Title:** This is INSANE, I found a life hack fr



What I found was 'writing a diary with the contents for my self-intro'!!! WTF I can't believe i , myself thought about it.

Tdy's Topic : **What kind of environment did I grow up in?**

I was grown in **a rather lonely** environment until i was **about** 7. **Because of my parents' careers,** Me and my parents lived separately. Instead, my granny took really good care of me. **STILL** I THINK I HAVE A LACK OF AFFECTION deep down on me. I really concerned about what other ppl think of me, and maybe that's connected.
But **putting that aside,** I also grew up in **a** warm, peaceful, and relatively affluent environment. And for that, I'm **truly thankful** to god and my parents - for all this thing I could have.
