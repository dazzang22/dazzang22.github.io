## Introduction to Data Communication

### Data Communication (DC) 's Components - 요소

*message* (메세지) : Data to be exchanged

*Sender/Receiver* (송/수신자) : Device that sends/receives data message. ( = End System / Host )

*Medium* : The physical path by which a message travels from sender to receiver.

*Protocol* (프로토콜) : **A set of rule** that govern data communication. Without a protocol, two devices may be connected but **NOT COMMUNICATING**. ( 통신 규약 )



### Relationship between the Communicating Devices 

**Line Configuration** : attached to a link ( 회선 구성방식 )

**Transmission Mode** : Direction of signal flow between two linked devices (통신 방향성)

#### Line Configuration 

* Defines the way two or more communication devices **attached to a link.**

  * *Link : **physical communication pathway** that transfer data from one device to another*
  * There are two types : PTP (Point-to-Point) / Multipoint

  ##### Point-To-Point

  * Provides a **dedicated link** between two devices. ( 전용 링크 제공 )
  * **Entire capacity of the channel** is reserves for transmission between two devices. ( 두 개의 장치 간 전송을 위해 전체 채널을 할당함 )

  ##### Multipoint

  * **More than two** devices share a link. (다중접속 허용)
  * Capacity of the channel is **shared**. ( 공유 채널 )

#### Topology ( 네트워크 망 구성방식 )

* Defines the physical or logical arrangement of links.

* **Mesh** : PTP / Every device has dedicated **PTP link** to every other device.

  * n = 전체 디바이스 개수

  * Link 개수 (NUMBER OF LINKS = K )
    $$
    K = n(n-1) / 2
    $$

  * 한 디바이스 당 연결된 포트 개수 ( Number of ports per device = k )

  $$
  k = n-1
  $$

  * **Advantages**
    * Higher speeds ( dedicated line )
    * No latency ( dedicated line )
    * Robust ( 견고함 )
    * No collisions ( dedicated lines )
    * Easy identification and isolation of faults ( 오류 식별 및 처리 용이 )
    * No single point of failure ( 단일 장애지점이 없음 )
    * Easy to reconfigure ( add / remove device = 회선 재구성이 용이 )
  * **Disadvantages**
    * Requires a large amount of cabling and I/O ports
    * Expensive ( 위와 같은 이유로 회선 추가비용이 비싸다 )
    * Does not scale well ( 재구성은 용이하지만 확장성이 좋진 않음 )

* **BUS**

  * **Multipoint** 
  * One long cable acts as a backbone to link all devices
  * Nodes - Drop Line - Tap - Bus cable
  * **Advantages**
    * Shortest cabling requirements
    * inexpensive
    * scales well
    * Ease of installation
  * **Disadvantages**
    * Slow ( Shares lines )
    * Collisions
    * Latency
    * Not robust
    * Single point of failure
    * Difficult to reconfigure ( add/remove a node)
    * Difficult to identify and isolate faults

* Star Topology ( PTP 스위치만 다룬다 )

  * Older : center HUB / Newer : center Switch 

    * **NON-BROADCASTING **: PTP dedicated lines

    * Broadcasting  : lines connected together and **shared**

  * **Advantages**

    * Higher speeds ( dedicated line )
    * No latency ( dedicated line )
    * Robust ( 견고함 )
    * No collisions ( dedicated lines )
    * Easy identification and isolation of faults ( 오류 식별 및 처리 용이 )
    * Easy to reconfigure ( add / remove device = 회선 재구성이 용이 )
    * Scales very well ( **Tree topology** 라면 확장성이 매우좋다 )

  * **Disadvantages**

    * No single point of failure ( 단일 장애지점이 있음 / Central SWITCH 가 고장일 시 모두 작동이 안됨 )

  * Tree 형태

    * Central HUB : Tree Root / **active hub**
    * repeater that regenerates the receives bit patterns before sending them out.
    * Secondary HUBs : active or passive
    * If it is passive : only **provides a simple physical connection** between the attached devices.

* **RING**

  * Each device has a dedicated PTP link only with the two devices on either side of it.
  * **Advantages** 
    * Relatively easy to install and reconfigure.
    * Relatively short cabling requirements
    * Medium expense
    * Scales well
    * No collision 
    * Suitable for fiber optic medium
  * **Disadvantages**
    * A break in the ring can disable the entire network.
    * Slow ( one device transmits at a time )
    * Latency
    * Not robust
    * Single point of failure ( ring and token )
    * Difficult to reconfigure ( add/remove a node)
    * Difficult to identify and isolate faults
    * Token problems ( lost, duplicate, first token)
    * **Communication is simplex** 

* **HYBRID**

  * 여러가지 topology를 혼용함

|        | Type       | Speed | Collision | Latency | Robust | Reconfigure | Faults | Scales |
| ------ | ---------- | ----- | --------- | ------- | ------ | ----------- | ------ | ------ |
| Mesh   | PTP        | Fast  | X         | X       | O      | GOOD        | GOOD   | BAD    |
| BUS    | Multipoint | Slow  | O         | O       | X      | BAD         | BAD    | WELL   |
| STAR   | PTP        | Fast  | X         | X       | O      | GOOD        | GOOD   | WELL   |
| RING   | PTP        | Slow  | X         | O       | X      | BAD         | BAD    | WELL   |
| HYBRID |            |       |           |         |        |             |        |        |



### Computer Networks 

* Interconnected collections of devices ( = Node )
* Provide communication services to exchange of data between end system
