**Title:** Why I'm still so blue?

Still sinking. I can't stand this rain. I really wanna get free from him.
Why do I have to care bout him, since we are broke?

Tdy's Topic: What kind of person do I think I am?

I dont' know myself exactly, but I'm kinda talkative but introvert person. I really like to talk with others but I get tired easily while I'm with others. I'm a person who knows the value of solitude. These days, I'm alone and this makes me stronger. 
I'm not that strong person, so I need to train my self to get stronger.

I have a mental illness. So I'm a person who really lives my life busy. I can't stop myself from getting rest. The time I stop is when I feel depressed.

And I love writing some notes. Even with a pencil or keyboard, just writing down what I lowkiely thought makes me motivated and delighted.  I'm simple but complex. I don't know myself, though.
