📝 **Title:** Life is SO LONE

Getting better and better these days. Still so many doubts about my feature.
Can't stop thinking of him. What's wrong with me?
All the time we spent together is useless now. Turned to ash.

I need to go up higher till I can see down. Never underestimate myself. Never look back.

Don't die till ur dead to me.
