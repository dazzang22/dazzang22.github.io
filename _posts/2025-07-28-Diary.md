📝 **Title:** Feel so blue

2 days ago, I broke up with my ex. 
He was really fine, but also strict with himself.

He told me, " Get busy, and you'll forget about me." 
WHAT A psychotic saying is it?

But...he was right. I restarted my Git page, and this is making my day more and more productive. Thx to him fr.

I'm still confused. Smts feel lonely. 
But now I have confidence that I can change my life by MYSELF.

Why was I so dependent on him? STUPID

But not anymore.
